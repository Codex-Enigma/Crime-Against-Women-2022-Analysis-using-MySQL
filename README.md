# Crime Against Women in India (SQL Project)

## Overview
This project analyzes crimes against women in India using SQL, providing insights into the patterns, trends, and distribution of crimes across various regions. The dataset used in this project is based on the 2022 statistics of crimes against women and covers a wide range of offenses.

The primary objective of this project is to explore and extract meaningful insights by performing SQL queries, visualizing crime statistics, and highlighting areas that require attention from law enforcement and policymakers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information on various types of crimes reported against women across India in 2022. The dataset contains the following columns:
- **State/UT**: The state or union territory where the crime was reported.
- **Crime Type**: Type of crime (e.g., rape, dowry death, domestic violence).
- **Number of Cases**: Total cases reported.
- **Year**: The year in which the data was collected (2022).

## SQL Queries
Key queries included in this project:
1. **Crime Distribution**: Identifying which crimes are most prevalent across different states.
2. **State-wise Analysis**: Analyzing the states with the highest and lowest crime rates.
3. **Top Crimes**: Determining the top 5 most reported crimes.
4. **Crime Comparison**: Comparing crime rates across states/UTs for similar types of crimes.

## Key Insights
1. States with the highest number of crimes against women.
2. The most common types of crimes reported.
3. Regional disparities in crime rates.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Used to write and execute queries for data analysis.
- **MySQL**: Database management system for running SQL queries.
